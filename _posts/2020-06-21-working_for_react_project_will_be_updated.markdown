For the start, I am actually pretty tired of myself being indecisive. At first I chose to challenge myself to create a weather app using external API, which was definitly the wrong choice as a beginner to React, Redux and external API itself. I found myself getting stuck on the idea of what will I need to persist in the backend? Later came to be needing an authentication to have persist data from my original idea.

The authentication didn't go well. There's a lot of lecture walkthrough for setting up the authentication, but I was just not able to get the page redirect working on my end, while the data is able to send to backend. THEN, after working on authentication for 10 hrs straight, on the same day at night, one of the most emotion event happened... my pet passed away(he got stuck), due to me forgetting the time to check on them when they are out. It was the hardest thing that hit me a week before the due date for project.   

After that feeling of lost...., I was finally able to get back on my code, and I was actually pushing myself to try to get something done at least, but still it took me a couple of days to get myself back together. 

After a short talk with my cohort lead and struggles with how I want my weather app to be like(without auth), I finally decided start on new idea for project while there's only 3 days before it's due.

This new app idea is a PetDiary (I think you can tell where this is coming from). 

This app has no authentication. It is just an app for recording the pet information and the post(diaries) I write for myself to keep track of the memories I have with them.

After working on it for first 2 days, I am finally more comfortable working with React, but the Redux was still kind of fuzzy. However, I am not fully done with the project yet, I will update this blog post with more detail once I am done with it.
