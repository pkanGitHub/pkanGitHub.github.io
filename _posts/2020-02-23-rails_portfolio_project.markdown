This Rails project was definitely not easy. If you are going to the last half of Rails section, it can be hard, but you should start thinking what you want your models and join table be. I messed up and create a brand new project while I've already spent a week on it because of what I chose to be my join table became really complicated with how everything structure in the controllers and routes can be very complicated when you have *nested routes* which is also a requirement in the project. So for those who are going to be doing the project soon, think as throughly as you can before you start making your models.

For my new project, I decided to make a music blog where users can review/write blogs for their favorite songs. But what I wasn't thinking is the way I want it doesn't contain *many-to-many* relationship that was also required in the project. So I had to do a lot of thoughts changing while doing this project. AND which I ended up with having 1 song and have many users write something like comments/their reviews below whichever songs they want to comment on. Everything didn't end up with what I've planned mainly because I wasn't able to get through the labs knowing everything I need to know before the project week start. It is a very hard project so far, maybe everything will get better in next project with javascript involve?

I believe it'll be so much fun if I know how all the Rails Magic works during the project, but those magik can be confusing because you don't know why it is working behind the scene, I will still need to add some stuff into my app and refactoring them, so I'll be updating a better blog after I'm done everything.
