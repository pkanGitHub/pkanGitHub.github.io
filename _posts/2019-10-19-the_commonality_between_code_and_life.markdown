When I ask myself, "What is code?" and "What is life?" or even "Is there anything in common?"...

An echo came in mind... "Um... Is there anything not in common?!"    

There are many times, we just don't think about it, but when you do, you will realize how code and life are so much related. Even when someone tell me "Code is Life",  I would agree with it. But of course, we do want to see examples to have more concrete ideas of why code "IS " life.

Sometimes, when you are out doing something, have you ever think "AH, I did something similar while coding?" 

I have, and I bet you do too. 

When people have to follow a set of rules and pretty sure that can occur anywhere,  like when there is DOs and DON'Ts and DO THIS before you DO THAT and there's a lot more. 


Lets talk about some actual examples:

THINK about a blank local editor as a new born baby :

(We write code as we write our own life)

As soon as we were born, there's an environment we live in... 
(just like how coders start writing code in some recommanded environment)

But of course, not all of us like to stay at the environment we grow up with and sometimes we have move on or to build our own...
(We move to the environment for coding just because... or if one is smart enough to build his own)

The ideal way to live a life for most of the human beings are similar...
(Just like the structure we code the program to work)

If you don't stick close with the ideal way to live (school, find interest, develope interest, find job), you will be living in more difficult life.
(Run into errors because the computer doesn't understand your code, come in to having a hard time debugging)

...etc


HMMM.... Maybe this is still a little abstract. Lets put in some real life examples...

Okay, lets think.... 

Have you ever need to make decisions in life? I hope you do. LOL. 

What make it a decision? It is because we will think of consequences, like... "IF there is an accident on the highway THEN I need to avoid that route by going to a different route, ELSE I'll be stuck in traffic", 
as in code:

```
if accident = true
   go to a different route
else
   stuck in traffic
end
```

RIGHT? 

Or as we think about OOP... 

Everything is an object. For example, a school is build up with attribute of teachers, students, courses...etc. 

```
class School

attr_accessor :teachers, :students, :courses...

end
```

How about going to buy a customize car (with some interior/exterior design )? 

Lets say you tell the car dealer what interior/exterior parts you want that you have an image of it. You also know they are going to have it built for you, "BUT" you don't know how they are going to make it.  (Interfaces)

Finally, but not last, there's many thing we do in life involves with steps like "Algorithm" in code. The easiest example to think of is cooking. We can't put ingredients in the pan before we peel and cut them up, right? Well~ maybe you can, but logically we don't do it because it won't taste good. Therefore, we follow steps, peel them, shred them, cut them however way we are suppose to to make that dish THEN we will consider what to put in first, second, and so on. 

From these examples, do you see it more clearly how Code is so much related to life? Maybe you will start thinking (if you haven't already) what you do on daily basis that are also related to Code?
