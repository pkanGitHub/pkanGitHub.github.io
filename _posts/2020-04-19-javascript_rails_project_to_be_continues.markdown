Taking lesson from previous project with rails, I started to think about topic 3 days before the project weeks start while still catching up lessons (didn't get to any of JS OO). From all of examples given in the project resources, I was thinking to make a small interactive game, got all the sketches made with draw.io, and model decided, and thought it to be a SPA, stands for Single Page App, and which it is,  but I was told that the game I sketched out will not need a backend to store information..., so there goes my 3 days early. After then, I was stuck in a concept of how is it going to be a SPA without the user login (to store data?) Like back in our project 2(Sinatra) and project 3(Rails), both of them have user login, and it make perfect sense to not want other people to access and modify your data. Then I literaly spent first week of project week figuring out what exactly is a SPA? Other than most given answer (Google Drive, Google Map, Facebook... etc) still was not helping. I guess what exactly I was looking for is a much simpler webpage to identify it. 

The next thing struggles me was how can I have it with just "ONE" html. At this point, it's really the time to show your skill to manipulate the DOM. Asking the DOM to pull up some html when clicking onto a button and such. And yes the most confusing part of a SPA is that you can still have multiple page like, but also yes, you only write it inside of 1 html. 

I am still working on the project as I only got to get the minimum output of this project, which is having the user to input the form, and have a card showing on the page accordingly. So I can't speak in full yet. However, "The HARDEST "part of the beginning of the project was... 

1. You know how to work with Rails (but you can't have views in it). 
2. You know how basic javascript works (but you are trying to connect to the backend and get data from the Rails API).
3. You know how to make a beautiful looking html with styling (but since you didn't get to practice that many times while playing catching up)

Simply, putting them all together was a struggle.

Finally at the end of the first project week ( after sketched out and planned for 3 other topics), I finally decided what app to make that I will not need a user login. Since I like animals and I have 4 wonderful naughty ferrets, I decided to make a Pet Rehome Application (I chose it to be a rehome app simply because I see a lot of ferret owner trying to rehome their lil ones due to many reasons). 

I will update on this blog as soon as I finish the project.
