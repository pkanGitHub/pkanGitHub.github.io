First off, I knew some surface level of  C++ and C back in school (everything up untill array ), so when I came to Ruby, I did have a basic understanding of how the program works; therefore, earlier in the course was easier to understand. However, when I encounter Object Oriented Programming lesson, everything changes. I had a hard time understanding `class` method and `Instance` method, then came to `self`... etc. Just when I starting to lighten up the blur, of course time and tide wait for no man..., the First Project came in and no, I haven't got to Gems and  Scraping when I started the project.

From the beginning of Project, I really had no idea what the project is about until Sara(a cohort) show my a link to the Learn Instruct Videos. The way I learn is really being able to see examples and be able to go through them and understanding the concept. So it actually took me a couple days to know what I am suppose to do.

It actually took me some time to found a website I want/able to work with and starting on the outline of what I am looking foward to do in the project. Then ACTUALLY setting up the enviroment took me a while. Why? Because I started out with the local LearnIDE with my cohort lead, but since I set it up without knowing what I was suppose to do in this project. So after I set it up and went through the CLI Walkthrough Video and code along and after I know what website I was going for, I realizing this walkthrough only can help me half way. Because I wanted to change the name of the project and don't know how, I ended up deleting the whole thing and start over.  

This is my actual FIRST Project. During school, we might have done something similar to project, but with having the instructor's provide all the methods, information that we need and start coding. Nothing like this, pick your own topic and working on the certain thing along the line using Gems, Nokogiri and Scraping. So instead of everyone have REALLY similar code, everyone here working on this project has different information and different layouts.

The Project I was trying to work on is with listing out ANIME information gather from https://myanimelist.net/anime/season/archive. I was trying to have user input the year and select the season they want to look into, then it is suppose to list out the titles of that season and year. After choosing the title they want to see, it should also print out the information like how many episodes, the synopsis...etc of the anime. It really sounds easy, but really hard as a beginner level of OOP and little knowledge of html and css.

During the Project, the main difficulty for me while working on this project is... not knowing anything about scraping and how Nokogiri works when I started. So during project, the most difficult thing to get through is from getting stuck and not knowing how to pass the error while scraping. The most difficult part I encounter was knowing how to go a level deep(which is getting the page from the first page). And once gotten the second site working, now is to how to put the list out from the site that I scraped.

To be honest, starting the project really freak me out, but after start coding, there is endless excitment and nervousness came altogether throughout the process working on it. I was expecting to do more than what it ended up(so far), but because I had lack of knowledge this time. I just know I'll have to put more time in coding and practice than before to prepare for next project.
